# News Board

News Board is a mobile application developed with React Native that allows users to read news based on their own interests. Users can create custom filters to generate a news feed based on their specific interests.
Getting Started
Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have completed the React Native - Environment Setup instructions up to the "Creating a new application" step.
Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start Metro, the JavaScript bundler that ships with React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the root of your React Native project:

bash

# using Yarn
yarn start

Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its own terminal. Open a new terminal from the root of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your Android or iOS app:
For Android

bash

# using Yarn
yarn android

For iOS

bash

# using Yarn
yarn ios

If everything is set up correctly, you should see your new app running in your Android Emulator or iOS Simulator shortly, provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.
